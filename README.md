# How to read xml based RSS feed using PHP? #

In this app I am using simplexml_load_file() php function to read xml based rss feed. After retrive the data from xml feed using a foreach loop I am looping all the items are binding to html. Total number of records here I set to 32. You can increase this value depending upon your RSS feed.

main.css is the file which contains styles. Once after data fetched from rss feed you can customize the widgets as you need.

For your reference here I enclosed 4 to 5 sample images of widgets.
